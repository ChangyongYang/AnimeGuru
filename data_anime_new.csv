However, these mentally-awakened plants recognized the inherent threat of humans, and attacked them; the end result was a stalemate between the forest and the few remaining human centers. Agito's home city is green with life because the forest controls it. There is an uneasy peace which is facilitated by a small number of humans that allowed the forest to alter them to be in concert with itself. Being that his father is one of those, Agito's view of the forest is not one of fear but rather one that respects the human dependency. Agito will be challenged to prove this relationship when a random event gives the humans, who still see the forest as an enemy, a new perceived advantage in their war.",https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/origin-spirits-of-the-past,https://cdn.anime-planet.com/anime/primary/origin-spirits-of-the-past-1.jpg,1060.jpg
